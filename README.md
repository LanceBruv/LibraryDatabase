LibraryDatabase
===============

A java program that interacts with a mySQL database in order to allow the librarian search for book by ISBN, 
author first name, last name, middle initials, check out/check in books , add new users etc.

This is my first attempt at using the MVC architecture. I would write the code a little differently if I could do it over again, 
but it still classifies the program into 3 sections where each could be replaced by a new componenet
